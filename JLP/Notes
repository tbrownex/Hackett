Date format: They provided YYYY(WK) which I converted to 2018-01-01. You have to make an assumption about what day of the week to start on: I chose Monday

Data structure:
  - 274 unique weeks going from 1/1/2013 - 2018 week 13
  - Within a week there are Layout Groups; 334 unique
  - There are 341 unique Layout Group Names (more than Layout Groups)
  - 14 Layout Groups have more than 1 Name:
     - Layout Group 104 has Names 'TINNED LOAVES (CRUSTY)' and 'TINNED LOOSE BREAD (CRUSTY)'
     - Layout Group 25 has Names'HEALTH DRINKS' and 'ACTIVE HEALTH DRINKS'
       so those 2 are benign but then:
     - 444 has 'IMPULSE CONSUMER ELECTRONICS' and 'LAUNDRY ACCESSORIES'
     So we may want to remove 444 and similar from the analysis. There are about 5 of them

  - Not all Layout Groups are present in all weeks, which is surprising
     - minimum count of LG/Week is 223 with a max of 265
     
Parking lot disruption:
  the PDF (page 5) says it occurred week 26 (Jun 26) but I'm using week 24 (Jun 19). Close but worth discussing. No end date is mentioned; i used Jul 17 (week 28)

I used May 27 (week 22) as the start of the new layout.
