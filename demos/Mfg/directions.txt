Original data came in 3 groups:
    1. train_fd00
    2. test_fd00
    3. rul_fd00

I used Excel to convert the space-delimited files with no header to comma-separated plus headers. I dropped the "FD..." part from the name, so you have "train1", "test1" and "rul1"

The "test" and "rul" files go together: rul holds the Remaining Useful Life for each test case. The link between them is "unit".

These are 4 different sets of Test Cases: data can't be mixed

I used Alteryx to prepare the final Train and Test files

"Train" files failed after the last cycle - so it's indirectly labeled.
"Test" files have a subset of cycles which you are to use for forecasting. The actual RUL is in the rul file

Next steps:
1. the NN predictions looked wacky
2. check the TODO
3. run with "genFeatures" on
