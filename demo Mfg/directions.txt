Original data came in 3 groups:
    1. train_fd00
    2. test_fd00
    3. rul_fd00

I used Excel to convert the space-delimited files with no header to comma-separated plus headers. I dropped the "FD..." part from the name, so you have "train1", "test1" and "rul1"

The "test" and "rul" files go together: rul holds the Remaining Useful Life for each test case. The link between them is "unit". The 4 test and 4 rul files all have their "unit" renumbered from 1 so that won't suffice: need to renumber so unit is unique.

For training, Unit doesn't matter so I left those files as is (no merging)
For testing, Unit does matter so I merged the different test files and assigned a new, unique Unit

"Train" files failed after the last cycle - so it's indirectly labeled.
"Test" files have a subset of cycles which you are to use for forecasting. The actual RUL is in the rul file
