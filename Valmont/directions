All the data is stored in ~/data/Hackett/Valmont:
    - Fred/ has datasets I selected randomly
    - Factset/ has Tony's download. The download itself is in the .xlsx and is not suitable for a CSV so I used
    Excel to strip out the formatting and create the "daily", "weekly", "monthly" extracts
    - Valmont's labels ("Revenue" and "Volumne") are found in "ValmontData.csv". That comes from Tony and Brett
    who sent the original file going back to about spring of 2018.

So the idea is to merge the two sets of MEI data (from Fred and Factset) for the features, then append the labels from ValmontData

1. Run "1a prepFactset" which will merge all the Factset stuff into one file
2. Run "1b prepFred" which will do the same for Fred
3. Run "merge" which will join FactSet and Fred, then apply the Valmont label
Now the data is in one file and ready for input to ML
